          <span>
            the Book Spot is a unit of Gobind Bhawan Karyalaya registered under
            the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (presently governed by the West
            Bengal Societies Act, 1960). The institution’s main objective is to
            promote and spread the principles of Sanatana Dharma, the Hindu
            religion among the general public by publishing Gita, Ramayana,
            Upanishads, Puranas, Discourses of eminent Saints and other
            character-building books & magazines and marketing them at highly
            subsidised prices. The institution strives for the betterment of
            life and the well-being of all. It aims to promote the art of living
            as propounded in the Gita for peace & happiness and the ultimate
            upliftment of mankind. The founder, Brahmalina Shri Jayadayalji
            Goyandka, was a staunch devotee and an exalted soul. He was much
            given to the Gita as the panacea for mankind’s plight and began
            publishing it and other Hindu scriptures to spread good intent and
            good thought amongst all. The Governing Council (Trust Board)
            manages the institution. The institution neither solicits donations
